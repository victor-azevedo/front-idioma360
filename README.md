## About

Idioma 360 is a comprehensive web application designed for the management of a language course platform. This versatile platform caters to two distinct user roles: administrators and students.

With Idioma 360, administrators have full control over the platform's functionalities. They can effortlessly create, edit, and delete courses, classes, selection processes, and exams. This ensures that administrators have the necessary tools to maintain and enhance the learning experience for students.

Students, on the other hand, benefit from the user-friendly interface of Idioma 360. They have the ability to apply for various selection processes and participate in corresponding tests. This empowers students to actively engage in the language learning journey and showcase their knowledge and skills.

Idioma 360 aims to facilitate selection processes for both organizers and participants. This platform is designed to streamline and simplify the entire selection process experience, benefiting both the organizers and the participants involved.
